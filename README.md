# Solo Adventure Game Engine

The soloadventure game engine is a way to write solo adventure games in markdown

Each adventure is devided into chapters. Each markdown file is for one chaper and they are then divided into sections each separated by headings. The first section (this) is not visible in the gameplay.

The first section also contains a code part with settings and game states that do not change during the game, as tables.

```json
{
  "assistant": {
    "textContext": "rewrite the text in a more formal way",
    "imageContext": ""
  }
}
```

## Help <!--- #help -->

The adventure is written i markdown which is a "lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor". it might be a good idea to learn the basics of markdown before you get started.

- The game engine uses only some of the styling elements for the game. Other elements is discarded during "compilation" of the text.

Section Navigation: Links starting with "#" are internal anchor links and is used to navigate to other sections within the same chapter. The autogenerated comment next to the heading is the id for that section.

- [Back to top](#background)

Chapter links:Links starting with / are links to other chapter can be combined wtth # to navigate to a specific section within a chapter. When navigationg to a chapter the current state of the game is also aadded to the navigation](#help)

## Images <!--- #images -->

there are three ways of getting images into your story. All of them is using the image tag. "![image alt text](url to image)"

Use existing from internet:
just add an image tag referencing an existing image hosted somewhere else

Paste from clipboard: find an image and then use copy image or take a screenshot into clipboard. the image can then be pasted inte the editor.

Generate with asistant
use the chatGPT assistans to generate an image from a description.

## State and variables <!--- #state-and-variables -->

To be able to write more complex games than just different links between chaoters the state can be used to store and alter variables that can be used later on. The initial state is defined in the action in the first chapter

The variables can ve used in text, actions and conditions. and is defined by {variableName}. the text between the brackets will be replaced by the state value of that variable exist in the state

- [Actions](#actions)
- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)


## Actions <!--- #actions -->

actions define a change of the state. usually altering or setting one or more values.

set a value by just write that value to the variable. if the value do not exist it will be created. The action is written in JSON or JSON5.

```json
{
  "setVarable": 1,
  "increaseByOne": "+=1",
  "rollD6": "[d6]",
  "rollVarableD10": "[{setVarable}d10]"
}
```

## Rolling dices <!--- #rolling-dices -->

Dices is defiened with square brackeds with a dice notation e.g. "[d6]". The engine uses the Dice Roller lib so most dices are supported.

examples:
roll a d20 : [d20]
roll a d6 with advantage:  [2d6k1]

## Conditions <!--- #conditions -->

To be able to show different text or run different actions based on differnt curcomstances a condition is used. It is defined by two or three markdown blocks of code.

You can either use variables in the state or roll dices in the condition.

`{health}<0 {`

your journey ends here

- [Start over](#start)

`}`

or with an "else" block

`[d20] <= {agility} {`

You take a graceful jump over the fence

`}:{`

You stumple on the sharp razorfence and get a deep cut in the leg, but manage to get over.

```json
{
  "health": "-=[d6]"
}
```

`}`

## ChatGPT assistant <!--- #chatgpt-assistant -->

Usage of ai in creative processes is controversial.

- Rewrite text

to rewrite text just mark it an press the chatgpt icon.

"you enter the door"

into

"You proceed through the entranceway."

the text context un the settings can be used to set a context to be used for all texts.

- Generating images
Mark an image tag with only the description of the image and press the ChatGPT icon.

context for all images can be added in the settings in the first section of a chapter. it can be both image style and context. like "comic book style in a dark forest" the text will just be appended to all image descriptions before sent to chatgpt.

<!--- An imaginatively fearsome manticore, with its lion-like body, bat wings spread wide open, and the tail of a scorpion poised, is seen mid-flight in the sky. It is swooping down, aiming its lethal tail towards a quaint village nestled among green hills below. Thatched roof cottages, a cobblestone main street, and a variety of villagers are frozen mid-activity, looking up with a mix of awe and fear. There is a farmer of Hispanic descent, a Black blacksmith and a South Asian woman running a bakery. The scene captures the sudden chaos and suspenseful anticipation of an impending attack. -->

An comment will be added to the image that is the rewitten prompt that is used by dall-E uses to create the image. It can give some hints on how to rewrite the description to make it mor suitable to you needs.

- Create the story

Its not possible to create the funn story with the game engine but with a cleaver crafted prompt its possible to let chatgpt to create a complete solo adventure directly in markdown.

"Create a solo adventure game about a astronaut entering an abandoned spaceship drifting in outer space. The ship contains an alien lifeform. return the story as markdown raw format. the sections should reference eachother with anchor links. also add image tags to the sections"

you might need to write "continue" to get the full story if ints not complete in the first respons. And then you need some cleanup and image rendering.
